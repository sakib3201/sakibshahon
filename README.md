# My Portfolio site
---

This current portfolio site is still under development and will likely change continuesly for quite some time. 
Also if you are directly going to use this file remember to fix the internal links. In order to ensure that the website works properly in github pages most internal links contain 
the prefix "sakibshahon"(repo name) in them just remove the repo name and it will e good to go.

To open the site click on the index.html file.
